This shader allows you to create shiny looking radial progress bars that can be used to display information like character HP, loading status, matchmaking rating progress, car speed, etc. The possibilities are endless.

THe shader can be edited through [Amplify Shader Editor](http://amplify.pt/unity/amplify-shader-editor) and contributions to the project are always welcome!

You can also just download a **unitypackage** from the releases tab and easily import everything to your project. This will not download the _screenshots_ folder.

# Getting started

To get this shader up and running you only need to attach it to a material, and drop that material onto a quad. That's it, you now have a basic HP Bar!

Best is to check the examples provided to get an idea on how to tweak the different parameters, and to take inspiration from them.

# Donate [![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)](https://www.paypal.me/adultlink/5usd)

This piece of software is offered for free because I believe the gamedev community can benefit from it, and it should not be behind a paywall. I learned from the community, and now I am giving back.

If you would like to support me, donations are very much appreciated, since they help me create more software that I can offer for free.

Thank you very much :)
